Soko-Scheme v1.0 by Boro Sitnikovski
====================================

To clone me: Write `git clone git@github.com:bor0/soko-scheme.git`

You can run DrRacket on `main.rkt`. Logic is kind of based on `git@github.com:bor0/soko.git`.

Written for Itch.io's [Lisp Game Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2018).

Work timeline (2-3 hours a day):
- Day 1: Implement logic (`game.rkt` and `level.rkt`).
- Day 2: Initial implementation for `soko_ui.rkt`.
- Day 3: Finish implementation for `soko_ui.rkt`.
- Day 4: Integrate all the parts together.
- Day 5: Refactor/beautify code, fix allthebugs.
